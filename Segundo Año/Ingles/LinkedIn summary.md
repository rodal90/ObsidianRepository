I’m a junior programmer specializing in Java and JavaScript, with a passion for problem-solving and an endless curiosity. My programming journey began while working in a call center when I realized that technology not only simplifies processes but also has the power to transform lives. That’s when I decided to dive into coding and started learning Java and JavaScript.

Since then, I’ve developed projects that have taught me the value of clean, efficient, and well-structured code. My focus on continuous improvement has helped me overcome complex challenges.

I’m a determined individual who doesn’t shy away from obstacles. My growth mindset drives me to always seek new knowledge, whether it’s learning new technologies or improving existing skills. I’m excited to apply my knowledge and keep growing in the world of development, contributing creative and efficient solutions.
